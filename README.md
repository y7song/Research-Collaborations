This set of scripts is writtern to process and visualize tranist smartcard data based on the concept Data Cube
The three major components are 
  (1)clearning up and proprocessing the data for the original data cube; 
  (2) select and aggregate the data to construct 2D plot of the data cube; and 
  (3) visulaize the 2D plots.

The scripts have been edited to show the effectiveness and efficient of applying data cube to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of transit usage across MULTI-DIMENSIONS and VARIOUS AGGREGATION LEVELS for each dimension. 

The scripts could be used to create GUI in the future if needed.

A randomly sampled subset of data is included for testing purpose. 

If there is any question or comment, please feel free to contact the author through email yingsong@umn.edu.
